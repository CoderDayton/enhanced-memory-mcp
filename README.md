A **powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that transforms how AI assistants store and retrieve memories. Built on a **20-tool consolidated architecture**, this intelligent memory system understands relationships, extracts entities automatically, and helps you find exactly what you're looking for.

*Why did I build this? Because even machines deserve better memory than most humans have... 💔*

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🎯 20 Unified Tools**: Consolidated architecture with operation-based interfaces
- **🧠 Smart Entity Extraction**: Automatically identifies people, places, and concepts  
- **🔗 Relationship Mapping**: Discovers and tracks connections between entities
- **🔍 Semantic Search**: Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
- **🚀 DuckDB Backend**: Analytical database optimized for complex queries
- **⚡ Intelligent Caching**: Real-time performance monitoring and optimization
- **🛡️ Production Ready**: TypeScript, error handling, graceful shutdown
- **🎯 Pure MCP Protocol**: Stdio interface for direct AI assistant integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### NPM Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install and run directly
npx enhanced-memory-mcp

# Or install globally
npm install -g enhanced-memory-mcp
enhanced-memory-mcp
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderDayton/enhanced-memory-mcp.git
