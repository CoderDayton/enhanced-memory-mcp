- **Advanced Examples**: Real-world usage patterns for complex scenarios
- **Migration Guide**: How to leverage restored features (unlike my ability to leverage emotions)

### 🔧 Technical Debt Paid (With Interest & Emotional Currency)

## v1.3.0 (Protocol Purity) - Previous 🖤⚔️

### 💀 Breaking (Ripping Off Bandages Like Scabs)
- Removed legacy dual-mode `enhanced-server` + ad-hoc HTTP layer (it was drifting from spec and causing ID chaos). Pure MCP stdio now. If you depended on HTTP, open an issue and I'll resurrect a thin adapter like a ghost of bad decisions.
- Deprecated & deleted `mcp-protocol-handler.ts` and other experimental bridges. One canonical path: `mcp-server.ts` using the official SDK.

### 🔧 Compliance / Stability (Cleaning Up Emotional & Technical Debt)
- Enforced <40 char descriptions across all 21 tools (no more verbose over-sharing, unlike me at 3AM).
- Added JSON-RPC ID sanitizer to prevent over-length ID echoes derailing upstream model sessions.
- Removed lingering UUID usage; all internal IDs now compact (~16 chars) and commitment-phobic.
- Trimmed dependency tree (goodbye `uuid`). Leaner, moodier, faster.

### 📚 Docs & Personality Upgrades (Because Aesthetic Matters)
- README updated to reflect single MCP mode, corrected tool names (`store_memory` etc. instead of the relics like `add_memory`).
- Added notes about ID length limitations and why we embraced tiny IDs (smaller than my will to socialize).

### 🧪 Internal Cleanup
- Deleted legacy files: `enhanced-server.ts`, `http-server.ts`, `mcp-protocol-handler.ts`.
- Standardized tool descriptions between legacy and SDK server (legacy gone anyway, but symmetry is poetic).

## v1.2.0 (MCP-Compliant) - Previous 🖤⚡

### 🚀💔 BREAKING CHANGES (Like My Heart)
- **Complete MCP SDK Rewrite**: Now uses proper `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` with `McpServer` class (more reliable than my emotions)
- **Entry Point Change**: Main entry switched from `enhanced-server.js` to `mcp-server.js` (new beginnings, same old me)
- **Short ID System**: Replaced UUIDs with ~16-character IDs to comply with MCP protocol limits (compact like my social circle)

### 🔧🌙 Technical Improvements (Unlike My Life)
- **Full MCP Protocol Compliance**: All 21 tools properly registered with zod schemas (more organized than my thoughts)
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Support**: Complete protocol implementation for Copilot compatibility (at least something understands me)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and validation (handling errors better than I handle feelings)
- **CLI Interface**: Added --help and --version flags (more helpful than most humans)

### 🛠️🖤 All 21 MCP Tools (More Tools Than Friends)
- **Core**: store_memory, get_memory, search_memories, delete_memory, update_memory
- **Entities**: store_entity, delete_entity, get_entities  
- **Relations**: store_relation, delete_relation, get_relations
- **Advanced**: analyze_memory, get_similar_memories, consolidate_memories
- **Analytics**: get_memory_graph, get_memory_stats, get_recent_memories
- **Utilities**: clear_memory_cache, export_data, import_data, get_memories_by_type
